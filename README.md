# Solid Guide
Hello there, 

If you're here you may wonder what this repo is about. Well, it started out with the same intention that it has today: learning (yes, it's only been a couple of weeks since the repository was created) and practicing full stack technologies.

As of this writing, this repo (`monorepo`?) is now housing different projects, one full stack url shortener and soon-to-be pushed reactjs front end practice projects. 

## Solid?
Why solid? that... that's sheer happenstance, as this `solid-guide` repo name was what github suggested. And, as I was looking for what projects to exercise my newly-found, and yet-to-be honed react skills. The whole "solid" trope started to take shape in my silly head, and well, you may see me labelling stuff like "solid notes, bruh", it's not meant to be insulting, _it's a joke, bruh!_ it's meant to be like.. well, a helper like clippy, but with a flipped up polo shirt collar.

## Solid Apps, Bruh

### Solid URLs
A URL shortener the lies of bit.y or paste.bin.

### Solid TODO
React.js TODO apps, because that's where we all start?, I guess?


## Documentation
You may see a docs directory here and there, these are mostly notes from where I did my research into implementation pieces. I guess I may be aging myself, but yeah, don't trust AI all that much to go and modify code for me, so.. no vibe coding here, but feeling the vibes, you could say. Some, if not, depending on when you read this, most of the docs you see are from a response to claude.ai, which, in this short period of time, I've found to be the most centered of the AIs I've tried, and it gives it's answers in markdown, which is very much a yes, please for me -- more on my uses of markdown at some point, I guess.
